requirement: nodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. open terminal here
2. npm install, enter
3. npm run start, enter. wait until shown "[HTTP Server] serving at: http://localhost:8888/Simulator/index.html"
4. open browser, go to http://localhost:8888/Simulator/index.html
5. fill Connector URL with ../ura.html
6. click "Start Interactive Phase"
7. in newly opened browser tab, click "Get Private Residential Property Transactions"
8. after it closed, and go back to main page, scroll down, and click "Fetch Table Data"

note:
- testing data would be pretty large totally, about 30MB, and it would crash the browser on step 8
- tips for testing: open ura-get-data.js, comment out or delete line 85-87, and re-run "npm run start"
- it will only fetch batch-4 data, which is smallest then the others
